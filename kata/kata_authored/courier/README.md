# Courier  

ðŸ”¨Î¥our friend Python just called you to hang out afterwards but you haven't finished you job yet. You are working at a courier company and you know which deliveries have left so you just need to calculate the time it will take you to complete them.ðŸ”¨
```
  courier(arr,n)
```
âš« The arguments of the function is an array with all the locations of the delivery points and n the maximum number of packages you can carry at once.

âš« It takes 2 minutes to load the packages at the store.

âš« It takes 2 minutes to hand a package to the consignee.

âš« Even if there are 2 or more consignees at the same location it will take 2 minutes each to complete the delivery. (For example 9n and 9n)

âš« If the array is empty return 0.

âœ… Your task is to calculate and return the least possible time it will take you (in minutes) to deliver all the packages and return back to the store.
```
        | n |
        |   |
        |   |
 -------+   +-------     X = (0,0) is the location of the courier store
  w       X       e      
 -------+   +-------     There are four directions (West,East,North,South)
        |   |
        |   |
        | s |
```
âš« The first character is the direction and the second the minutes that it takes to get there if you follow that direction.
```
arr = ["w3", "e5", "n7", "s2", "s1", "w5", "e7", "n13", "w6", "e2", "e4", "e1", "n9"]
```
ðŸ’¡ Example:
```
arr = ["w3", "e5", "n7", "s2", "s1", "w5", "e7", "n13", "w6", "e2", "e4", "e1", "n9"] 
n=3

Route:
